# Notes
## Some vim commands
### Left-right motions
 - `f{char}` To [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right.
 - `F{char}` To the [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.
 - `t{char}` Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right.
 - `T{char}` Till after [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.
 - `;` Repeat latest f, t, F or T [count] times.
 - `,` Repeat latest f, t, F or T in opposite direction [count] times.

### Delete and insert
 - `["x]c{motion}` Delete {motion} text [into register x] and start insert.

### Simple changes
 - `r{char}` Replace the character under the cursor with {char}.
 - `gU{motion}` Make {motion} text uppercase.
 - `gu{motion}` Make {motion} text lowercase.

## Shell script programming tips
### Error handling
It can be very useful to add the following settings to you shell scripts:

    # Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special
    # parameters "@" and "*" as an error when performing parameter
    # expansion.
    # same as 'set -o errexit'
    set -u
    
    # Exit immediately if a pipeline (even a single command), a list,
    # or a compound command exits with a non-zero status.
    # same as 'set -o nounset'
    set -e

Homework is to check the effects of:

    # If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last
    # (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all
    # commands in the pipeline exit successfully.
    set -o pipefail

You can turn these settings off (and on again) for small portions of the
script, too, with *set +u*, etc.

### Use more functions
 - Instead of comments, use functions. Sometimes, you can turn a short
   comment into a function name.
 - Try to make the functions short. To be more readable, comprehensible.
 - Try to make the functions reusable. Use parameter lists.
 - In the functions, where appropriate, use the *local* keyword for the
   variables to not let them propagate outside of the functions.

Example:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    set -u
    set -e
    
    GLOBAL_VARIABLE_WITH_ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS=999
    
    main() {
        delete_something
        create_something_because_it_is_needed
        create_something_just_for_fun "${@}"
    }
    
    delete_something() {
        local sleep_time
        sleep_time=$((GLOBAL_VARIABLE_WITH_ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS / 999))
        echo "Now deleting..."
        sleep "${sleep_time}"
    }
    
    create_something_because_it_is_needed() {
        create "needed"
    }
    
    create_something_just_for_fun() {
        create "fun" "${@}"
    }
    
    create() {
        local name="${1}"
        shift
        echo "creating, because it is ${name}"
        for arg in "${@}"; do
            echo "  arg = ${arg}"
        done
    }
    
    main "${@}"
