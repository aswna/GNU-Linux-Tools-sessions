# Notes
## Modifying previous Python script
For background see the [notes of session 13](https://github.com/aswna/GNU-Linux-Tools-sessions/blob/master/13/notes.md).

An additional request was to see the full record (at least the PCAP
sequence ID). So, we need to modify the script to show that.

Also, note that due to floating point representation the timestamps are
not exact, only approximate values.

You can see the solution of the team (we had only a few minutes) [check_duplicates.py](https://github.com/aswna/GNU-Linux-Tools-sessions/blob/master/14/check_duplicates.py).

You can see a reference solution by me [check_duplicates.py](https://github.com/aswna/GNU-Linux-Tools-sessions/blob/master/14/solution/check_duplicates.py).
