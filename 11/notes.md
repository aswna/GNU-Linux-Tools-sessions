# Notes
## Scripting exercise
### Are you ready?
Write a script, which prints out the following upon execution:

    Hello, <USER>!

where, the <USER> is replaced by the user started the script.

The next line should be "prompt", which asks:

    Are you ready or not? [y/n] 

Note: there is a single space character at the end of this line and it does
not contain newline character!

If the answer is 'y' (yes), then it should print:

    OK. You are ready!

otherwise it should print:

    Fine. Then take your time, check back later...

You can download the test script [test_script.exp](https://github.com/aswna/GNU-Linux-Tools-sessions/blob/master/11/test_script.exp), which will test your small program.
